## **Apple Pay Exemplary Technology**   

Apple Pay set out to improve on the effeciency and securtiy of traditional card payments. With Apple Pay customers could pay directly  with their devices which has already 2 factor authentication built in via Touch ID, Face ID, PIN or passcode. This deleted the vulnerable magnetic interface of traditional credit cards.
Apple Pay went further when they introduced a transactional feature called "tokenization". This development facilitated an unprecedented secure form of payment. This "token" method refers to the substitution of data associated with a financial transaction that consists of sensitive banking details of the customer making the payment, with nonsensitive data. The way it works is that for each transaction there is a single use credit card number used. This temporary number essentially makes fruad almost a non issue.

## **Future For Apple Pay**

Apple Pay has grown and continues to do so by leveraging Apple's consumer products to capture a growing share of the payments space. Their utilization of apple ID and icloud sync features make it easy for consumers to add data (including financial) once and keep it there. This makes it unappealing for the consumer to leave their chain of products.
Partnering with difficult ‘to tame’ industries such as the Music Industry.
With Apple's commitment to expand their focus on services to compliment their evolving cunsumer products Apple Pay will undoubetedly continue to innovate and introduce new features in the Fintech space.
